My name is Jomon.
As of today, I have read many manhuas, manhwas, and a dozen or so books, light novels, and mangas.The journey has been amazing so far.
But it's becoming extremely hard to find time to read.
Last year, I restarted reading light novels, and they had me hooked for too long (I am still not off the hook).One hour is the least I read every day.
Sometimes it goes up to ten hours.
I mostly read on my phone.
I found a really good reader application named 'Moon Reader' last year, and since then, I have been using it to read.Finding a physical book to read is hard since buying one is not an option because I'm broke.
The only option is borrowing, but that comes with its own disadvantages.There seems to be an invisible force making it hard for me to start reading a normal paper book, whereas I can read an e-book anytime.This reading habit has robbed me of sleep for over four years.
This year has been the worst of all—the average sleeping time is 2 o'clock.
I have realized that it's affecting my health and eyesight pretty badly, yet I still can't stop for some reason.I feel like it has become more of a habit or addiction—maybe, I don't know for sure.
Anyway, if you are reading this, thank you for listening to my thoughts about my messed-up hobby and health.
I will leave you with a question: 'Don't you have anything better to do than reading my 1 o'clock self-talk that I'm writing for a program to perform a write operation in Java?'
